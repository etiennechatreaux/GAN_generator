# GANs for Synthetic Data Generation

## Project Overview
This project delves into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a fascinating concept where two neural networks (the generator and the discriminator) compete to produce highly realistic data. The generator starts with random noise to create data that mimics a real dataset, while the discriminator tries to classify if the input data is real or generated. This adversarial process enables the GAN to refine its output and produce increasingly realistic synthetic data.

Following the GAN implementation, this project will explore the potential of synthetic data to improve ML models performance, particularly when training on small datasets. (that's called Data Augmentation)

## Objectives
1) Understand GAN Architecture: Build and fine-tune a GAN model to generate synthetic data
2) Data Generation: Experiment with various techniques for data generation using the generator
3) Research Synthetic Data Utility: Investigate the effectiveness of synthetic data in training ML models, especially in scenarios with limited real data availability

The goal is to understand how it works and the limitations of GANs (hard to train)
