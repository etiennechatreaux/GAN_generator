This project explores Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) because I find the concept very interesting : 2 neural networks that "fight" to generate realistic data. The generator creates data from random noise, while the discriminator classifies whether the input data is real or fake.

After that, I will try to do some researchs on the use of synthetic data in small datasets to train ML models.
